Crover has also played the bands Men of Porn, Shrinebuilder, and Nirvana. He is the current vocalist and guitarist for the band Altamont.\\n\\nCareer\\nAfter Mike Dillard left Melvins, the band brought Crover in to drum for them. He was recruited out of an Iron Maiden cover band. In late 1985, Crover formed the band Fecal Matter with Kurt Cobain and Greg Hokanson. Hokanson would later leave the band. After he left, Cobain and Crover decided to record Illiteracy Will Prevail on a 4-track in December 1985 at Cobain\\'s aunt\\'s home in Seattle, Washington. The band would break up in 1986.\\n\\nCrover would end up drumming on Nirvana\\'s ten-song demo that was recorded on January 23, 1988 at Reciprocal Recording Studios in Seattle. He played a 14-song show with Nirvana in Tacoma, Washington, the night of the demo session. Three of the cuts from the show \"Downer\", \"Floyd the Barber\" and \"Raunchola/Moby Dick\" would appear on the 2004 box set, With the Lights Out. Crover would relocate to San Francisco, California along with Melvins\\' bandmate Buzz Osborne later in 1988. During Nirvana\\'s west coast tour with Sonic Youth in August 1990, he rejoined the band.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1967 births\\nLiving people\\nAmerican heavy metal musicians\\nAmerican punk musicians\\nAmerican rock drummers\\nAmerican rock guitarists\\nMusicians from Washington\\nNirvana members\\nPeople from Aberdeen, Washington'"

experiments next discover closely try pin location electron way toward detection screen others like likely miss target pinning location electron makes trajectory indefinite indeterminate uncertain trajectory made clear try locate electron along extension trajectory staked would find precise made knowledge trajectory less likely would find electron ordinary expectations would lead us believe pitchers threw electrons instead baseballs overhead camera sidefacing camera placed somewhere pitchers mound home plate exact position electron could determined mid flight without cameras turned pitcher would throw straight balls cameras turned pitches would start straight gyrate wildly pictures taken clearly know ball halfway toward home place trouble batter getting ready hit bat unexpected consequences uncertainty feature nature support understanding things nuclear fission control gave humans new powerful source energy quantum tunneling operating principle semiconductors important modern computer technologies technical discussions one almost always talks position momentum momentum product velocity mass physics idea velocity speed something going certain direction sometimes one also talk velocity thing question ignore mass sometimes easier understand things talk trajectory path something follows idea also includes ideas speed direction following diagrams show main features uncertainty concrete terms world real things later use little math able give clear idea much wiggle room position momentum diagrams humans learn uncertainty shortly werner heisenberg created new quantum physics something unexpected came right mathematics expression range error position x times range error momentum p equal greater planck constant divided π symbols put math form already seen pictures symbols say clear way cannot perfectly certain something going get clearer time less idea going fast get clearer going fast time less idea right scientists already learned certain substances give characteristic colors light heated otherwise excited heisenberg trying explain colors characteristic brightness would good enough scientists said well thats way sure good reason differences fact ratios among bright line strengths always sample element idea going stumble hidden secret nature set discover explanation intensities colored lines characteristic elements study quantum mechanics already shown hydrogen four bright lines part spectrum humans see must seemed next thing learn would simply calculate brightness hydrogen seemed obvious place start since hydrogen one electron deal four lines visible part spectrum surely must good reason equally bright explanation brightness differentcolored lines neon elements could wait heisenberg started working quantum physics adapting classical equations electricity complicated begin math behind paper hard follow trying find right way calculate intensity bright lines hydrogen lamp spectrum find related quantity called amplitude multiply amplitude amplitude words square amplitude get intensity wanted figure express amplitude way took account fact hydrogen lamps radiate frequencies radiate across continuous range frequencies part spectrum people see heisenberg found remarkable new way calculating amplitude strange equationequation heisenberg discovered used multiplication one quantum quantity eg position another eg momentum published called heisenbergs magical paper july math looks hard math leading much harder extremely hard understand given show looked like heisenbergs paper historical landmark many physicists read paper said could disagree conclusions could follow explanation got conclusions beginning equations heisenberg used involved fourier series involved many factors come back equation kind recipe writing multiplying matrices new equations strange unusual heisenberg describing strange world things orbits electrons slowly get larger smaller new kinds changes involve jumps large gaps jumps electrons jump certain orbits energy gained lost changing orbits produced photon right energy absorbed new photon right energy produced electrons hydrogen atoms frequently jump fall two particular orbits photons emitted energy level light produced level intense difficult make equations built continuous spectra see put suns light prism fit spectra peak frequencies nothing almost everything already learned light energy done large things like burning candles suns large objects produce continuous spectra even though ordinarysized things easy experiments still taken long time figure law physicslaws govern physicists dealing things small see things produce continuous spectra trying find way least get clues already knew would help find laws small gappedout light sources original equations dealt kind vibrating body would produce wave little like way reed organ would produce sound wave characteristic frequency motion back forward like vibrating reed emitted wave could graphed sine wave much earlier figured physics atomic level electrons moving around nuclei mass moves orbit rotates around kind hub called angular momentum angular momentum way something like merrygoround continue rotate people stopped pushing math used phase calculations angular momentum complicated top heisenberg show calculations paper even good mathematicians might trouble filling say even though many physicists said could figure various math steps heisenbergs breakthrough paper one recent article tries explain heisenberg got result uses twenty mathfilled pages even article easy understand math started really hard stuff would eventually produce something relatively simply shown top article getting simpler result easy going try show process getting outdated picture universe new quantum physics need enough detail show almost soon heisenberg made breakthrough part universe works nobody ever seen came view heisenberg must excited also tired late night finally made breakthrough started proving would work almost right away noticed something strange something thought annoying little problem could make go away somehow turned little nuisance big discovery heisenberg working toward multiplying amplitudes amplitudes heisenberg good way express amplitude using new equation naturally thinking multiplication would multiply things given terms complicated equations heisenberg realized besides squaring amplitude would eventually want multiply position momentum multiply energy time looked like would make difference turned order around new cases heisenberg think matter one multiplied position momentum one multiplied momentum position simple numbers would problem complicated equations got numbers plug equations turned different depending way got started nature measure position measure momentum else measure momentum measure position math general situation prevailed see english wikipedia article heisenbergs entryway matrix mechanics want learn fussy details tiny pesky differences results going remain matter much heisenberg wished would go away time heisenberg could get rid one little problem exhausted handed work immediate supervisor max born went vacation max born remarkable mathematician soon saw equation heisenberg given sort recipe writing matrix dr born one people time interested odd kind math people figured good much knew matrices could multiplied calculations accounting one physics problem could handled multiplying one matrix another able put complicated procedure standard acceptable form would make easier work might also make easier people accept born good mathematician almost immediately realized switching order multiplying two matrices would produce different result results would differ small amount amount would hπi everyday life difference would small could even see formal theory uncertainty took couple years heisenberg able prove uncertainty principle says δx δp h number comes original equations leaves π phase changes heisenberg explained derived uncertainty principle earlier result wrote paper introducing theory constant written h called planck constant mysterious number often occurs need understand tiny number

two closely related h another pair physical quantities goes according uncertainty relationship δe δt h pair indicates among things look interstellar space place would expect find anything reduce δt closer closer keep balance shown equation δe get larger larger suddenly something momentum pop existence brief period time indeterminacy lack certainty explained going universe often said new theory successful provide new information phenomena investigation heisenberg created math model predicted correct intensities brightline spectrum hydrogen without intending discovered certain pairs physical quantities disclose unexpected uncertainty moment nobody idea measurements could forever made precise accurate fact could made certain definite stunning new discovery many people willing accept bohr colleagues argued photons electrons etc either position momentum measured theoretical position grew discovery uncertainty personal preference believe bohr said know nothing something like photon electron observe order observe small thing need interact somehow everyday life possible something like walking alongside automobile marking times crosses points grid drawn pavement perhaps weight automobile depress little levers pavement turn clocks attached record automobiles weight end would clear record car various times also could compute direction progress weight could know time clock position momentum velocity multiplied mass would even imagine force required move little levers would influence progress car would also imagine automobile location trajectory points pavement levers car exists kind threedimensional blur times settles depressing lever world familiar reveal strange kinds interactions locate ship sea darkest night could use searchlight light would disturb position direction travel ship locating electron light would require hitting one photons enough momentum disturb position trajectory electron locating electron means would involve holding kind physical restraint would also terminate forward movement locate photon best done without terminating forward movement make go circular hole barrier one knows time photon emitted laser instance time photon

circular hole made closer come knowing exact position photon goes however never know whether photon offcenter time hole exactly size photon wont pass diameter hole decreased momentum direction photon

atomic scale evidence support conclusion everyday life things definite time occur atomic scale evidence support conclusion everyday life one observes factory night shift day one day shift day two one sees finished automobile rolled shipping dock would make sense say impossible tell whether delivered night shift day shift atomic scale show instances count single photon produced two times bad enough also show instances single photon produced two adjacent lasers part difficulty finding happening atomic scale would like know something trajectory know things time cannot measure position trajectory time either measure momentum photon electron one time without delay necessary measure position switch things around measure position first momentum second problem making first one take pretty definite

rest like wheel propeller living things move around rolling living things seem use wheels biologists written reasons writers science fiction fantasy invented many animals wheels wheels useful technology people many technologies people use also found nature like wings lenses may seem strange wheels never evolved nature two reasons first natural limits kinds things exist nature living things change slowly time process called evolution natural selection process create many different answers problem cant always create every answer imagined also ways new living things build process called developmental biology cant always create every kind part imagined second wheels sometimes less useful ways moving like walking running slithering like snake reason groups people past given using wheels completely known examples rolling wheels living things rolling living things move around rolling true examples wheels whole organism rotates without parts stay still like axle kinds animals form bodies circle cases protect cases able roll animals include caterpillars tiger beetle larvae myriapods mantis shrimp salamanders animals form ball instead animals include pangolins hedgehogs armadillos armadillo lizard isopods wheel spider fossilized trilobites animals may roll passively meaning pushed gravity wind actively meaning push changing shape tumbleweeds part plant grows ground tumbleweeds break roots roll wind order spread seeds dung beetles form round balls animal feces roll balls bodies although ball rolls instead beetle beetles many problems rolling animals kind skin cell called keratinocyte moves rolling part process healing kind tiny animal called rotifer uses ring cilia small hairlike parts moving rhythm move feed word rotifer latin means wheels rotifers actually parts rotate rotation like wheel known multicellular organism organism made many cells spin part body keeping rest body still however least two examples rotating parts used cells one example

flagellar motors talked biologists scientists study life think atp synthase example modular evolution modular evolution two parts different jobs join together pick new job known example nature part spin way around push organism flagellum flagellum tail used like propeller push singlecelled prokaryotes bacterial flagellum best known example half known bacteria least one flagellum means rotation may actually common way moving around found nature bottom bacterial flagellum meets cell membrane motor protein acts engine engine gets power proton motive force flow protons hydrogen ions across cell

meaning much energy wasted push bacteria fast times length every second motor bottom flagellum similar structure atp synthase bacteria called spirillum twisted bodies flagella ends spririllum bacteria spin around move kind organism called archaea different bacteria also use flagella powered rotating motor proteins two kinds flagella evolved different parts eukaryotic cells complex kind cell found

organisms developed wheels put simply complex structure one made several parts working together cant evolve unless early unfinished form helps organism live children modern science evolution adaptations changes affect fitness organism appear slowly many generations means natural selection genetic changes usually spread population lower fitness individuals neutral changes changes dont raise lower fitness spread genetic drift cases changes lower fitness spread large changes take many steps spread steps raises fitness biologist richard dawkins describes situation way metaphor fitness landscape useful traits peaks harmful ones valleys wheels may useful peak valley around peak low wide gene pool set genes population move genetic drift natural selection stephen jay gould points evolution build parts already available writes wheels work well animals debarred prevented building structural constraints limits inherited evolutionary legacy natural selection therefore explains wheels appeared wheel without one important parts would probably help organism much however true flagellum discussed flagellum evolved different parts structures used new purpose part rotating motor called basal body may evolved part used bacteria inject poisons cells use existing parts called exaptation biologist robin holliday written living things wheels creationism intelligent design stories life claim intelligent creator less likely right holliday argues intelligent creator free limits evolution would use wheels place would useful limits bodies grow people found fairly easy build wheeled systems even complex ones able solve problems power transmission moving energy one place another friction however ways new organisms build different ways humans build things clear processes life would

would useful driving wheel directly also animals use muscles cycles joints move one direction instead moving one direction constantly large animals cannot gain speed quickly difficult muscles pull large inertia resistance heavy object movement friction machines lubricant like oil grease bearing used limit friction rubbing moving parts keeping friction important limiting wear damage parts keeping parts getting hot faster parts move force important reduce friction animal joints like human knee friction reduced tissue called cartilage low coefficient friction lubricating fluid called synovial fluid low viscosity resistance flowing gerhard scholtz professor institute biology comparative zoology humboldt university berlin written similar lubricating fluid material dead cells could help animal wheel turn freely something like never seen nature moving nutrients waste wheel another problem flow materials living wheel tissues form wheel living must receive oxygen nutrients wastes taken away order continue metabolism process using energy maintain functioning normal animal circulatory system network tubes allow blood flow would able provide necessary flow materials without blood flowing materials would diffuse wheel diffusion limited partial pressure surface area rule called ficks law diffusion large animals diffusion would enough keep tissues alive instead living wheel wheel could made dead material like keratin makes hair nails problems wheels environments wheels simply good limbs getting around may even possible wheels evolve would found often nature fact given limits

desk land floor ceiling book newton also used laws show planets revolve around suns orbits oval round newton also discovered diffraction led enter field physics prospered newtons three laws motion following three laws motion first law law inertia newtons first law motion states object pushed pulled force stay still keep moving straight line steady speed easy understand rocket move unless something pushes pulls harder understand object continue move without help think rocket someone flying rocket jumps rocket stopped happens rocket continues goes space tendency object remain still keep moving straight line steady speed called inertia second law law acceleration second law explains force acts object object accelerates direction force moving someone gets bicycle pushes pedals forward bicycle begin move someone gives bicycle push behind bicycle speed rider pushes back pedals bicycle slow rider turns handlebars bicycle change direction formula showing law fma force acting object equal mass times acceleration third law law reciprocal actions third law states object pushed pulled object push pull equally opposite direction someone lifts heavy box use force push box heavy producing equal force downward lifters arms weight transferred lifters legs floor floor presses upward equal force floor pushed back less force person lifting box would fall floor pushed back force lifter would fly air discovery law gravitation people think isaac newton think sitting apple tree watching apple fall people believe apple fell onto head newton understood makes things like apples fall ground specific kind force force call gravity newton thought gravity force attraction two objects apple earth also thought object matter exerted force smaller objects exerted meant large mass earth pulled objects toward apple fell instead people float air isaac newton went thinking gravity newton people thought objects near earth would fall newton thought gravity limited earth objects gravity went moon beyond newton invented formula calculating force attraction two bodies used calculate force needed keep moon moving around earth compared force made apple fall downward allowing fact moon much farther earth much greater mass discovered forces moon held orbit around earth pull earths gravity formula invented newton called law gravitation impact sir isaac newtons calculations

within certain limits even surrounding temperature different aspect homeostasis keeping constant internal environment endotherms socalled warmblooded animals control temperature body quite high level ability called endothermy mammals birds endotherms homeotherms homoiotherms basic source heat chemical energy bodys metabolism number temperaturecontrol devices cold things make warmer example shiver shake run move warmer place movement animals creates heat chemical reactions respiration polar bears freeze metabolism produces heat movement produces heat hibernation bears exist several degrees lower active life course warmblooded animals thermal insulation hair feathers water blubber thick fat adaptations help keep heat energy inside animal warm sweat become cooler pant open feathers move less hot place lie hibernation colder climates many mammals hibernate aestivate means twolevel metabolism temperature held high level active lower level hibernating advantage saving energy times cannot get enough food keep higher temperature humans human body automatic responses help regulate temperature external environment heats arterioles leading capillary loops dermis dilate widen increases blood flow surface skin heat easily radiate away process called vasodilation sweat glands also produce greater amounts sweat liquid secreted onto surface skin sweat needs energy turn liquid gas evaporate energy called latent heat vaporisation body supplies heat cools sweat evaporates body unable maintain normal temperature increases significantly normal condition known hyperthermia occurs occurs body exposed temperatures approximately c exposure longer hours temperature around c kills opposite condition body temperature decreases normal levels known hypothermia fossil groups palaeontologists fairly certain fossil groups endotherms obvious examples pterosaurs whose bodies covered hair hairlike filaments smaller carnivorous dinosaurs evolved feathers dinobirds thought feathers originally functioned keep body temperature higher appear birdlike dinosaurs flying birds anchiornis huxlei appear dinosaurs heavy fly heterotherms heterothermy term animals features ectothermy endothermy switch strategies basic physiology fundamental idea smaller endothermic animals relative mass larger body surface heat loss takes place surface order keep warm animal must produce heat rate equal loss animals make heat metabolism inside bodies lose heat surface mostly skin bodies threedimensional whereas surface twodimensional animal length x doubles length surface area increases x body mass increases x example threeinchlong animal doubles length six inches result surface area increases proportion x square inches body mass increases proportion xx cubic inches since energy production related body mass animal better respect energy balance thus larger animals much energy efficient smaller animals large animals lose heat relatively slower small animals surface area smaller proportion strategies small animals small warmblooded animals three main tactics overcoming problem heat loss first higher metabolic rate large animals universal birds mammals details differ higher metabolic rate affects whole lives main reason shorter lives large animalsp smallest mammals shrews smallest hummingbirds size weight fast heartbeats per minutep use calories per gram endotherms rate oxygen use similarly high result metabolism running high rate produce heat per gram living things second many allow temperature drop night many hummingbirds go trancelike torpor night one bird increased heart rate morning beats per minute degrees c beats per minute degrees c state less aware less able take flight greater risk predators however asleep cannot feed normal rate metabolism need sugar regularly torpor way saving energy cannot replace next day thirdly almost endotherms insulated reduce heat loss obviously true birds feathers land mammals fur marine mammals thick layers fat skin better insulation wet fur exceptions large mammals elephants almost fur problem get rid heat problem really large land animals african elephants solution large ears well supplied blood vessels wallow water available likely problem affected large dinosaurs largest titanosaurs far larger land animal alive today ectotherms ectotherms often called coldblooded function properly need heat usually heat surroundings many need heat order digest food many supposedly coldblooded animals things keep temperature higher surrounding air water fastmoving fish like tunny sharks keep temperature level surrounding water reptiles lizards snakes sit sun cold shade hot insects control temperature especially colonial insects termite mounds air conditioning system openings galleries
